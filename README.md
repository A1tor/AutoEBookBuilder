The project was done during university studies in January 2025th.
I didn't really care about it and made it in under then 4 hours. Thats why project is bad in almost every aspect.
My requirements for this project were:
1) С#
2) Forms
3) Any DB
4) Various sorting algorithms
5) Cover code with unit-tests


Main feature of this project is runtime compilation of addons a.ka. APIs for different book formats e.g. PDF, DOCS, Fb2, EPub
These addons could be created manually as a C# class and added to the APIs folder during runtime
